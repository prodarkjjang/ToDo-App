# Frontend 
## Todo app part - Title / Add new todo(CREATE) / List all todo(GET) / Delete a todo(DELETE) / Edit a todo(UPDATE) / Mark as done(UPDATE) / Hide & unhide done
## Work from top component to inner component

# Backend
## Use node.js or django + fastapi
## Add a database 
## Change frontend so that it calls api from backend instead of using front end var

## Add new route to new page to see/edit details of todo

# Add authentication of members to crud access
